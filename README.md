  Lyric Guesser is an interactive web-based game where players aim to identify a song by typing in words that match the lyrics. The game begins with all lyrics hidden, and itâ€™s up to the player to type in guesses to gradually reveal the lyrics. As players input correct words, more lyrics are uncovered, bringing them closer to discovering the name of the song.
